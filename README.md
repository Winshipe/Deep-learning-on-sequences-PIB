# Deep-learning-on-sequences-PIB

This repo is almost everything needed to run a snakemake workflow from my PIB. See the report for details

To run, this should be put into its own dir with a subdir called workspace.  You should already have [snakemake](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/#) and conda installed
